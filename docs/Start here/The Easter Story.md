# The Easter Story
<span class="center-me">#easter #passover #chuck-missler</span>

The following are my notes from a YouTube series by Chuck Missler on the Easter Story.   Part one can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyIz4oj_U6A&t=200s

## An Achievement to Celebrate
The Easter Story is an achievement.   The whole of the OT has been leading up to this point from the fall in Gen 3.


Separation by the Church from the Biblical text.  

## Quatrodecimans controversy

```ad-WellEstablished
title:Quatrodecimans controversy
collapse: closed

Quatrodecimans = fourteenism  refers to the original Christians that insisted upon fixing the celebration of [[Passover]] on the fourteenth day of [[Nisan]] in the Old Testament Calendar.  [[Lev 23#5]]

Exodus 12:14:
![[Exo 12#14]]

[[Antisemitesim]] was rife in the early Church.   And not surprisingly so, the Jews were seen as being responsible (at least in part) for the death of Jesus.   The early church view was **"they've had their chance, now its our turn!"**

The Christian chuch was operating under the Julian calendar based on solar years.  The Jews has always opperated on lunar years.

```

All of this to avoid [[Passover | Easter]] from falling over [[Pasover]]. 

## Friday or Wednesday

3 strong reasons why most scholars believe Good Friday is very likely Good Wednesday.


**Matt 12:40**
![[Matt 12#40]]

3 days and 3 nights. There is not enought time between Good 'Friday' and Sunday to have 3 days and 3 nights in between.   Wednesday fits perfectly.




**John 12:1**
![[John 12#1]]

6 days before Friday would be a sabbath.   The journey between Jerich and Bethany was 20 miles which is father than considered appropriate for a Sabbath.


**Matt 28:1**
![[Matt 28#1]]

>Sabbath can mean Sunday but also one of seven high Sabbath' (or festivals) throught the year.   In other words there were two Sabbaths between Passover and Sunday Morning.

```ad-Vision
title: Dave's Thoughts


As I read this I'm reminded how in our modern western mindset we've forgotten / lost / or not even been aware of, the connection between Easter and passover.  

Passover is the celebration of the Isrilites rescue from captivity in Egypt.  Which is a foreshadow of the work that Jesus did on the cross.

```



## Who is calling the shots

**Jesus.**  

Read the account of [[Matt 26#The Last Supper 17-30 | The Last Supper]] Judas was preparing for the betrayal but it wasn't the timing he was after.   The Jews would never have wanted to interrupt the Passover celebrations but Jesus forced his hand.  

Lets look a little closer:

**Matt 26:4**
![[Matt 26#4]]

The word treachery (see [[G1388]]) could have been translated subtly or in private.  They wanted to keep Jesus death quite.   [[Chuck Missler]] stated that Satan's plan would have been to kill Jesus by [[stoning]] but Jesus' plan was to fulfill the prophecy of death by a cross.   A prophecy that was made some 600 years before the method of crucifixion was invented.



**Matt 26:5**
![[Matt 26#5]]

This was a Roman province, the Romans would by and large leave the Jews to their own affairs as long as they kept order.   A riot would necessitate Roman intervention that no body wanted.


## Jesus' Final Week

 |                      | **Mathew** | **Mark** | **Luke** | **John** |
 | -------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
 | **Triumphal Entry**  | 21         | 11       | 19       | 12       |
 |                      | 22         | 12       | 20       |          |
 |                      | 23         |          |          |          |
 | **Olivet Discourse** | 24         | 13       | 21*      |          |
 |                      | 25         |          |          |          |
 | **Last Supper**      | 26         | 14       | 22       | 13 - 18  |
 | **Crucifixion**      | 27         | 15       | 23       | 19       |
 | **Resurrection**     | 28         | 16       | 24       | 20, 21   |
 

 *Although often claimed to be part of the [[Olivet Discource]] John 21 is actually a very similar but different account.    (I've heard this statement before from [[Chuck Missler]] I'll dig through my notes and create a note on this in due course.).

Exodus 6:6-7
![[Exo 6#6]]![[Exo 6#7]]

I am the LORD
- I will bring you out
- I will rescue you
- I will redeem you
- I will be your God

The four cups of passover are a reminder of the Jews being freed from Egypt.   It was this passover that Jesus was undertaking.  

Whats interesting is that that here we see that Jesus is sharing the third cup "I will redeem you" and then says v29:

![[Matt 26#29]]

Jesus does not drink that 4th cup.

In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were otherwise, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; so that where I am, you may be also.
