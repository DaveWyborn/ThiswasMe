Hello and welcome to my garden.

I've decided to take the plunge and share publicly my thoughts and reading notes.

You can check out Shu Omi's video on learning in public here:


```button  
name Why Public Learning is good for you!  
type link  
action https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549/  
```

```
Please excuse the formatting.

I'm including a bit of everything right now so I can test the formatting and build out the CSS (Style guide).
```



## What will I write about:

> My thoughts and notes will mostly be around biblical study.

My primary motivation for this is two fold.

On the one hand I feel like this is an area God is directing me in.  
Secondly, and probably not far from the above relates to the parable of the talents.   I want to make sure I'm sharing my tallents and not just burying them where no one can benfit from them.  

While the above is my main focus right now I no doubt will open space to look at some of my other interest around data visualisation (I am a data analyst by trade).


## For now there is not much for you to do
```ad-WellEstablished

Right now I'm working on my first few posts, I'm also procastenating a lot and playing around with styling and learning css.   I'm also trying to move house so it could be slow going for a little while.
