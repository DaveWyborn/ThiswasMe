Friday or Wednesday \u00b6 3 strong reasons why most scholars believe Good Friday is very likely Good Wednesday. Matt 12:40 ![[Matt 12#40]] 3 days and 3 nights. There is not enought time between Good 'Friday' and Sunday to have 3 days and 3 nights in between. Wednesday fits perfectly. John 12:1 ![[John 12#1]] 6 days before Friday would be a sabbath. The journey between Jerich and Bethany was 20 miles which is father than considered appropriate for a Sabbath. Matt 28:1 ![[Matt 28#1]] Sabbath can mean Sunday but also one of seven high Sabbath' (or festivals) throught the year. In other words there were two Sabbaths between Passover and Sunday Morning. ![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 11.png]] title: Dave's Thoughts As I read this I'm reminded how in our modern western mindset we've forgotten / lost / or not even been aware of, the connection between Easter and passover. Passover is the celebration of the Isrilites rescue from captivity in Egypt. Which is a foreshadow of the work that Jesus did on the cross. Who is calling the shots \u00b6 Jesus. Read the account of [[Matt 26#The Last Supper 17-30 | The Last Supper]] Judas was preparing for the betrayal but it wasn't the timing he was after. The Jews would never have wanted to interrupt the Passover celebrations but Jesus forced his hand. Lets look a little closer: Matt 26:4 ![[Matt 26#4]] The word treachery (see [[G1388]]) could have been translated subtly or in private. They wanted to keep Jesus death quite. [[Chuck Missler]] stated that Satan's plan would have been to kill Jesus by [[stoning]] but Jesus' plan was to fulfill the prophecy of death by a cross. A prophecy that was made some 600 years before the method of crucifixion was invented. Matt 26:5 ![[Matt 26#5]] This was a Roman province, the Romans would by and large leave the Jews to their own affairs as long as they kept order. A riot would necessitate Roman intervention that no body wanted.
